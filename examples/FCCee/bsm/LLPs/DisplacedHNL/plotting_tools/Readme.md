## Overview

This text file describes how to produce ratio plots for comparing Dirac and Majorana HNLs.
Below is a description of how to modify `make_selection.py` and `make_plots.py`.

## make_selection.py
This script is used to select the variables to be plotted. It returns a .root file containing the selected variables histograms. You must run it both for your Dirac and Majorana samples. 
### How to adapt it to your needs
First, specify the path of the input file. The input file corresponds to the output file of '''analysis_final.py'''. The path should look like :
'''/afs/cern.ch/user/d/dimoulin/FCCAnalyses_new/Analysis/outputs/HNL_Majorana_ejj_20GeV_1e-3Ve/output_finalSel/HNL_Majorana_ejj_20GeV_1e-3Ve_selNone_histo.root'''
Next, specify the variables to be plotted, e.g if you want to plot the reconstructed electron energy (RecoElectron_e) you must include the line :
'histSelect.WriteObject(hist_file.Get("RecoElectron_e"), "RecoElectron_e")'
Finally, specify the name of the output file e.g : 
'output_file = "histMajorana_ejj_Select.root"'
You can then run the script using 'python make_selection.py'

## make_plots.py
This script produces ratio plots of the previously selected variables.
### How to adapt it to your needs
You need to specify the path to the selection files :
'input_file_Dirac = 'histDirac_ejj_Select.root''
'input_file_Majorana = 'histMajorana_ejj_Select.root''
As well as the output directory : 
'output_dir = "20GeV_ejj_plots/"'

Then you must add the selected variables to the 'variables_list'.

### Miscellaneous
You can modify the legend by modifying the second entry of 'files_list', as well as the colors of the graphs by modifying the 'colors' list. Finally, the plots are currently saved in .png, you can modify this to any supported extension you like.
